                        <p>Designed by Peter Moore, the Jordan 1 originally released from 1985 to 1986. Quite a few colorways of the model were produced, as well as a few different variations. Following its initial run in the 80s, the Jordan 1 jumpstarted the retro era in 1994, following Jordan's retirement from basketball. The shoe returned again in 2001, including the introduction of a Jumpman branded mid-top. It wasn't until 2008 that Jordan Brand started re-releasing the Jordan 1 with its original high cut.</p>

                        <p>Since then, the Jordan 1 High has had a relatively consistent presence in the market, as it's been featured in the 22/1 Collezione ‘Countdown’ Pack. the Doernbecher freestyle series and commemorated Jordan's Hall of Fame induction in 2009. In recent years, the shoe has enjoyed a heightened level of popularity behind the retro of the canvas-based Air Jordan 1 KO, Nike SB collaborations and the highly anticipated return of OG "Nike Air" branding. Jordan Brand has also been packaging the Jordan 1 in a retro box-inspired by the original 1985 design.</p>

                        <p>Originally released in 1987, the Air Jordan 2 was designed by Bruce Kilgore. The sneakers were made in Italy, providing a premium feel to them. They released in two colorways, available in high and low top. In 1994 they were retroed for the first time, one colorway was released in high and low. Somewhere in-between 1994 and 2001, the original molds to the Air Jordan 2 were lost and broken. This would result in Jordan Brand not being able to retro the Air Jordan 2 ever again. Their solution, the short-lived Nu' Retro Air Jordan 2, which was released in three colorways in 2003 and featured a shrouded upper, sitting atop a new sole.</p>

                        <p>All was not lost as Jordan Brand was able to recover one of the original molds to the Air Jordan 2, and they would be re-released for their first retro run in 2004. Three high top colorways were released along with two low tops. This included a limited edition "Melo" pair, which was identical to a player exclusive pair Carmelo Anthony wore throughout the 2003-04 NBA season, without the "Melo" personalizatons. In 2005 the Air Jordan 2 Retro Low continued with one-off colorways for both men and women.</p>

                        <p>The Air Jordan 2 Retro would return in 2007 and become the first Air Jordan to be included in Nike's Doernbecher Freestyle collection. In 2008, the Air Jordan 2 Retro was included in the Jordan 21/2 Collezione 'Countdown' Pack, and a limited edition 'Eminem' pair was released as an online exclusive, limited to 313 pairs. 2010 would mark the second retro run of the Air Jordan 2. Eight colorways would release including the original white, black and red pair for a third time. Jordan Brand would also switch things up on the Air Jordan 2 this time around, replacing "Nike" on the back heel of all the non-OG colorways with "Jordan," and "Air" on the back of the "Bin23" and "Silver Anniversary" pairs.</p>

                        <p>We would have to wait until 2014 before we would see the Air Jordan 2 Retro again. Five colorways were released, including the original white/red colorway, which was last seen in 2008s Countdown Pack. In 2015 Don C teamed up with Jordan Brand on a limited edition colorway of the Air Jordan 2. Inspired by the original, they feature premium materials and came in special packaging. 2016 looks promising for Air Jordan 2 fans as Jordan Brand has a slew of releases already planned.</p>

                        <p>The Air Jordan III was originally released in 1988. It was the first Air Jordan designed by the legend, Tinker Hatfield. They said goodbye to the ‘Wings’ logo and debuted the iconic ‘Jumpman’ logo we are all familiar with today. In addition, they  were also the first Air Jordan to feature visible air and elephant print on the upper. Four colorways dropped, which are all classics today.</p>

                        <p>After Michael Jordan’s first retirement, Nike brought back the Air Jordan I, II and III for a short two colorway per model retro run in 1994. The Air Jordan III was the last in the line of the ’94 Retros due to MJ returning to the NBA. In 2001 the Air Jordan 3 Retro would get its first retro run, with three colorways dropping in the span of five months. Two original colorways returned which also led to the beginning of the end of some iconic elements featured on Air Jordan Retros. The OG black/cement colorway was the last to feature original ‘Nike Air’ branding while the ‘True Blue’ colorway was the first OG to feature ‘Jumpman’ branding in its place.</p>

                        <p>In 2003, the Air Jordan 3 Retro returned for a one-off release of the original white and cement grey colorway. We would then have to wait four years, until 2007 for them to return for their second retro run. Seven colorways were released during that time including the original ‘Fire Red’ edition for the first time and a new ‘Flip’ version which featuring a full elephant print upper for the first time on the AJ3. A women’s exclusive colorway as well as two limited ‘LS’ releases and two other GR’s rounded this set out.</p>

                        <p>The original black and cement grey colorway was re-released for the third time as a part of the Air Jordan 20/3 Collezione (Countdown) Pack in 2008. In 2009, Europe got a surprise when the ‘True Blues’ returned exclusively overseas and never made it stateside. One year later, the Air Jordan 3 Retro joined the Nike x Doernbecher Freestyle collection and featured a full translucent outsole for the first time. That paved the way for the 23rd Anniversary of the Air Jordan III in 2011 which saw Air Jordan 3 Retro releases throughout the entire year.</p>

                        <p>Favorites like the black and cement grey and ‘True Blue’ colorways were brought back as well as the second ‘Flip’ edition and a limited edition colorway, made to commemorate Black History Month. Since then, the Air Jordan 3 Retro has had a few small runs in 2013 and 2014. This included the Air Jordan 3 Retro ’88 in white and cement grey that featured original ‘Nike Air’ branding on them for the first time since 2001s black/cement grey release.</p>

                        <p>The year was 1989, and Tinker Hatfield was back at his tricks storming up an idea for the Air Jordan 4. How would he top the Air Jordan III? Air Jordan Original 4 IV MilitaryTinker wanted to get further into performance, rather than some other inspiration that was used on the last three models.</p>
                        <p>The Air Jordan IV was the first in the line that had an over-molded mesh. The reason for this is, the consumer would think the shoe was made cheap. So what Tinker did was dip the mesh in a soft plastic and blew air through it to clear out the plastic in between.</p>
                        <p>When the Air Jordan 4 was first released in 1989, people disliked the shoe, said it looked very ugly. Overtime the model grew on a lot of people. Another feature of the AJ IVs was the capability to lace your IVs in 18 different patterns. This gave your IVs your own style. Air Jordan 4 Fire RedThe overall personality of the Air Jordan 4 was saying “get back to work”. Michael was a father and husband for the first time in his life, and since the Air Jordan III was such a luxurious model, MJ and Tinker wanted to bring back to the original draw board.</p>
                        <p>When the AJ IVs were first released in 1989 they retailed at $110.00. In 1999-2000 when the IVs made another appearance they sold for $100.00, also in 2004 they retailed for $110.00. In 2005 Air Jordan did a collaboration with Undftd, auctioning off the shoes between $1500.00 to $2600.00. Also a AJ 4 Laser package was released with a t-shirt and hat that retailed for $200.00, and later that year Jordan Brand released a black color way of the laser IVs that retailed for $175.00. In 2006 a pair of “Rare Air” IVs released with a price tag of $125.00.</p>

                        <p>The Air Jordan 5 was released in February 1990. Four models of the Air Jordan V was released to the public. Original Air Jordan 5 V Grapes Two models which are the Black/Black-Metallic Silver and White/Fire Red-Black had MJs number “23” on the side. Limited to only 100 pairs each, and were given to unfortunate kids or auctioned off as charity.</p>
                        <p>The Air Jordan V was the first in the Air Jordan line to have a clear rubber sole. Tinker Hatfield also designed the Nike Marty MacFly’s featured in the movie Back to the Future II, they had clear molding which allowed light to come through, and that is were Tinker got the idea from.</p>
                        <p>Also the AJ 5 was the first time anyone had ever molded foam into a shoe upper.</p>
                        <p>When you look at the AJ V besides the icy soles, what else do you notice? What I notice is the flames on the side. Tinker came to the conclusion that the way Michael performed was “like a Fighter Plane”. When the AJ 5 was designed, the inspiration was “grey nurse shark” or Super marine Spitfire MkVIII, which is a World War II British fighter plane. To add to the finishing touches of the shoe, Tinker added a reflective 3M tongue with Jumpman embroidery.</p>

                        <p>Originally released in 1991, Michael Jordan wore the 6 en route to his first NBA championship.</p>
                        <p>On the Air Jordan 6 Michael Jordan gave direct orders to have a clean toe, so Tinker Hatfield made sure the Air Jordan VI had a reinforcement around the toe, making the AJ VI the first basketball model to obtain this. MJ had problems putting on the past five models, so Tinker designed two holes on the top of the tongue, and one loop on the back, calling it “a spoiler”.</p>
                        <p>The Air Jordan 6 was the second model to have the clear rubber sole. When the Air Jordan V was released a lot of people complained that their children were falling because the soles would collect dust that was on the court, making the sole slippery. Now on the Air Jordan VI Tinker added a more solid rubber, so this problem would not happen again.</p>
                        <p>Michael wanted the heel tab positioned so it did not hit his Achilles tendon, making the Jordan 6 the first shoe to have any sort of molded structure on the back. The last touch Tinker gave was incorporated the number “23” on the design of the shoe.</p>

                        <p>Tinker Hatfield could be inspired by anything when it comes to the Air Jordan line. Air Jordan VII HistoryOn the Air Jordan 7 when Tinker was in Portland, he saw a poster that was African art, influenced by an Afropop Worldwide. The person in the poster was playing a guitar shaped like Africa. Around the time when Tinker was ready to design the Air Jordan VII Michael sat down with him and mentioned that he wanted the shoe to “stay young and interesting, while remaining sophisticated”.</p>
                        <p>Tinker had now went inside the store and asked to purchase the poster, but the owner did not want to sell it because he was advertising a radio show and the Afropop music. Tinker had now told him he worked on the design of the Air Jordan line. The store owner decided to sell the poster to him for $15. All the lines on the Air Jordan 7 were influenced by Western African tribal patterns, which were on the poster. The Air Jordan VII was also worn by Michael Jordan in the 1992 Barcelona Olympics. Nike had made a special “Olympic” color way, and instead of the number “23” there was 9 on the back.</p>

                        <p>Tinker Hatfield wanted the Air Jordan 8 to not feature a Nike sign. He thought the Jordan Brand was strong enough at this point to hold its own. Tinker brought up to Nike that the Jordan line was strong enough to start eliminating the Nike sign at the AJ VI. After Tinker was done telling his story, Nike pretty much laughed in his face.</p>
                        <p>It took a lot of time, and a lot of convincing to make this happen, but it finally went through. If you look at the Original Air Jordan VIII model you will notice there is no Nike sign.</p>
                        <p>The Air Jordan VIII started a lot of talk through sneaker heads, basketball players, or people that enjoyed a pair of Nike’s. The design was crazy, the AJ 8 also had a polycarbonate torsion plate, and to top it all off, the color ways blew people away.</p>
                        <p>A sad feature about the Air Jordan VIII was they were not as comfortable as other Air Jordan models. Air Jordan VIII HistoryThe straps (also called bunny ears) would make the shoe tight on the sides, so people with wide feet had a hard time wearing them. What the Air Jordan 8 did have going for it is: durabuck uppers, Air sole, Huarache inner sleeve and anti-inversion cross-straps (aka bunny ears).
                        In 1993 the Original Air Jordan VIII released in three color ways. The Color schemes were White/Black-True Red, Black/Bright Concord-Aqua Tone and Black-Black-True Red. </p>

                        <p>Here is a comment from Tinker on the Air Jordan IX:
                        “The Air Jordan IX represented the globalization of the Air Jordan brand name. Everybody around the world wanted to be like Mike. Take a close look at the soles of the shoes, we designed the different languages around the world that describes the sporting spirit of Michael Jordan and what he has done for the world of sports.”</p>
                        <p>When asked what shoe should be on the statue of Michael Jordan in front of the United Center in Chicago, Air Jordan IX HistoryTinker said the Air Jordan IX, because the shoe represented MJ being a “global superstar”. The Jordan 9 came equipped with dynamic-Fit inner bootie, encapsulated Air-Sole unit (forefoot), large volume Air-Sole unit (heel), polyurethane midsole and “one-pull” lacing system.</p>

The quality of the shoe was up to par with huarache inner sleeve, leather uppers and quick lace system, but something was not right with them.</p>
                        <p>When the Air Jordan X was released, a lot of the models had a strap of leather going across the top of the toe, but then Nike came out with a clean-toed version (just how Michael liked his shoes). When Michael returned to the NBA he did wear the Jordan 10, with his new number “45” on the side.</p>
                        <p>In 1994 when the original release of the Air Jordan 10 came out, a total of three models released, and a regional pack which had five different color ways representing five selected teams. Those lucky teams are – Sacramento Kings, New York Knicks, Orlando Magic, Seattle Supersonics and the Chicago Bulls, and a pair of Air Jordan X cleats were released, all retailing at $125.00. When 2005 hit Jordan Brand knew it was time to re-release the Air Jordan X, so they sold for $125.00 and a total of 7 color ways and two of them were for women.</p>

                        <p>The Air Jordan 11 are loved by many sneaker enthusiasts and are always a sell out. Air Jordan XI HistoryMichael Jordan was now back in the NBA, and the Air Jordan XI was his shoe for the 1995-1996 season. But before Michael Jordan wore the model, Tinker had to design them.</p>
                        <p>Tinker Hatfield thought that Nike should pull out all the stops and make a shoe out of materials that had never been used in a basketball shoe. At first, Tinker was thinking of using some high-end nylons, but good thing he changed his mind. Tinker wanted the Air Jordan 11 to look like a convertible, with a shiny body, so that is why the Air Jordan XI had patent leather.</p>
                        <p>Not only was it the patent leather on the Air Jordan XI made them special, but the addition of a lightweight Phylon midsole with a full-length Air-Sole unit and full-length carbon fiber plate, as well as being supportive. But sadly, there were some defects in them.</p>
                        <p>For the look of the shoe itself, Tinker was (like always) thinking of some inspirations. If you’re an artist, then anything can inspire you, so when Tinker saw a yellow lawn mower you wonder how he fit that into the Jordan 11. According to Tinker:  Air Jordan XI History“There are designers out there designing lawn mowers to look like sports cars.”.In 1995-96 playoffs, Michael had a bad spill wearing the AJ XI, and the reason being is poor traction. Also the midsole would get creases very fast.</p>

                        <p>Nike Basketball was heading into a different direction with foamposite, shox, and big air bubbles in shoes. What can the Air Jordan 12 do to compete? Believe it or not the AJ XII got started with a woman’s fashion shoe from the 19th century called “Nisshoki”. Michael is big on fashion, and he knows women have a lot of it. He did not care if you made fun of him for wearing a women’s wrist band or something else feminine.</p>
                        <p>On the Air Jordan 12 there was more than just the women’s high heel for inspiration, but also the Japanese Rising Sun flag played a big role in the making. Air Jordan XII HistoryThe stitching down the sides resemble sun rays. If you look at past Air Jordan sneakers, you will notice the famous “23” located somewhere on the model. On the Air Jordan 12 Michael wanted a different look with his number 23. So an idea came to Michael Jordan to have 23 written down the tongue, written like this: Two 3.</p>
                        <p>A lot of good qualities were on the Air Jordan XII, for example they had the Zoom Air unit (also the first Air Jordan to have a Zoom air unit), modified herringbone pattern for improved traction and a more improved carbon fiber shank plate.</p>

                        <p>When the Air Jordan 13 was being thought up, Michael and Air Jordan XIII 13Tinker Hatfield did not have a meeting before they drew up designs. Tinker had an idea. If you’ve ever watched Michael play then you would see the resemblance between him and a panther. Michael Jordan would watch his players, and all of a sudden he would make the move, and before you knew what happened Michael had the ball.</p>
                        <p>Tinker later met with Michael and told him that he looked like a black cat, or panther. Funny thing was, between Michael and his friends, his nickname is “black cat”, for all the reasons Tinker said: he would read his player, and strike like a panther.</p>
                        <p>The sole of the Air Jordan 13 is one of the most unique soles ever released in the Jordan line. If you get a chance to look at the sole of them you will see a huge resemblance with a panthers paw.</p>
                        <p>By the heel of the Air Jordan 13 was a circle hologram. If you look close you will see the number 23, a basketball, and the Jumpman logo. A downfall of the hologram is they can get fogged up over time. Also over time the soles that are white will bleed (happens just about every time on the Original Air Jordan XIII).</p>

                        <p>The Air Jordan 14 has room in every ones hearts. Maybe not by the looks, but the Air Jordan XIV was the last model Air Jordan Michael Jordan wore in a Chicago Bulls jersey.</p>
                        <p>At the time Michael owned a Ferrari F355F1. The design of the Ferrari F355F1 looks exactly like the shield on the Air Jordan XIV, and the vents on the side of the Ferrari F355F1 were also used on the Air Jordan XIV.</p>
                        <p>The Air Jordan 14 was the first to have silver tips on the laces, which also had a Jumpman logo. Each pair had a total of seven jumpman logo’s, which together equals out to fourteen (XIV). Original Air Jordan XIV (14)Low profile Zoom Air Units were located at the forefoot and heel. If your feet sweat while you play, then the vent on the side should help out.</p>
                        <p>With all the good qualities of the Air Jordan XIV you might think nothing could go wrong with them, but sadly there are a couple minor flaws. The toe box area would come unglued over time. Also the teeth on the sides (phylon midsole) would crease very quickly.</p>

                        <p>Since Michael Jordan retired once again, people started saying that the Air Jordan line should be discontinued. But of course, Tinker Hatfield, Micahel and the other designers thought otherwise.  Air Jordan XV HistoryIt was time to look for inspirations, something different, something not previously used on another shoe.</p>
                        <p>So the idea of the Air Jordan 15 would be to pay respect to Michael and his years in the NBA. The X-15 fighter plane came into mind at the moment. This plane broke the speed records, and set its own at 4,502 miles per hour. The X-15 is the best there ever was, just like Michael.</p>
                        <p>Rumor also has it that the tongue on the Air Jordan XV is inspired by Michael Jordan, since he always sticks his tongue out when he goes for a dunk, shot, or layup.</p>
                        <p>Some nice features of the Air Jordan XV are the hidden quick-lace system, seamless dynamic-fit sleeve, Kevlar mesh uppers, Zoom Air sole, rubber herringbone pods, injected TPR external heel counter, and a breathable leather pattern. So the question is, how would the Air Jordan XV do with the consumers?</p>
                        <p>Sadly, the high expectations for the Jordan 15 to sell well were not met. The Air Jordan XV is disliked by many (and most likely the most hated Air Jordan). The quality of them was terrible, the inner sleeve was too loose, and very uncomfortable.</p>

                        <p>Wilson Smith III stepped in to be head designer of the Air Jordan 16. Air Jordan XVI HistoryWilson’s plan with the XVI was to add all of the main elements from the past Air Jordan models into one. Notice the patent leather on the toe box (Air Jordan XI), ribbed leather gaiter (Air Jordan XIV), 3/4 mid cut (Air Jordan III), mesh uppers (Air Jordan V) and clear rubber soles (Air Jordan V, VI, XI).</p>
                        <p>The return of the patent leather gave the Air Jordan 16 a dress look, which people wore with tuxedos (same on the Air Jordan XI), but of course the Air Jordan XVI was not as popular as the Air Jordan XI.</p>
                        <p>The Air Jordan XVI is the first model in the line to have a gaiter or shroud. The gaiter is removable, which made them look like a brand new shoe.</p>
                        <p>A downfall about the gaiter is that when worn during a basketball game, they could fall off. Also the Air Jordan XVI is a tight fit with the gaiter’s on. The Air Jordan 16 is very lightweight, but was stiff. Don’t get me wrong though, the Air Jordan XVI had great quality’s like a blow-molded Air unit in the heel, Zoom Air in the forefoot, thermal properties, breathable ballistic mesh upper and patent leather.</p>

                        <p>Tate Kuerbis was head designer of the Air Jordan 18. Tate was a part of Nike since 1995 and Jordan Brand since 1999. So designing shoes was nothing new to Tate.</p>
                        <p>Inspirations can be seen from different places on the Air Jordan XVIII, for example the “rubber heel wrap” idea came from race car driving shoes, the Carbon fiber-based monocoque (F1 race cars), and the bold stitching came from Italian dress shoes, but the overall outlook was from the automobile world (one of Michael’s adorations).</p>
                        <p>The Air Jordan 18 did not come with a fancy carrying case, or CD (which many of us enjoyed), but they did come with a nice slide out box, towel, brush, and an “Air Jordan XVIII Driver’s Manual” pamphlet.</p>
                        <p>Like always with the newest Air Jordan to release, Jordan Brand wanted to bring out the latest in technology. The Air Jordan XVIII contained air vents, carbon comfort plate, Air Jordan XVIII Historyhidden quick lace system, suede leather uppers and zoom air sole. Since the uppers were made out of suede, they did attract a lot of dust, dirt marks and scuffs. Also the soles and mid sole were made of rubber, and just like the Air Jordan V they collect dust, which can make someone slip and fall. If you played in an indoor gym, you were OK.</p>
                        <p>On the Air Jordan XVI and XVII, Jordan Brand would use the “+” for a modified model. The Air Jordan XVIII used a XVIII.5 or 18.5, which ever way you wanted to write them. Pretty much nothing changed except the removal of the cover, and the jumpman was now on the side of the shoe, also the date 1985-2003 was put on.</p>

                        <p>Inspiration for the Air Jordan 19 came from the deadliest snake in the world, the black mamba. When the black mamba feels threatened, it raises its body up in the air, shows its fangs, and makes a loud hissing sound.

Air Jordan XIX (19) HistoryThis material is used in the automobile industry. Tech-flex is a material which can stretch, and since it is used on the Air Jordan XIX it gave your foot the comfort you need.</p>
                        <p>Some great qualities of the Air Jordan XIX is a carbon fiber shank plate, phylon midsole, full-length zoom air unit, patent leather toe box, tech-flex upper, Velcro heel strap and plastic lace-locks.</p>
                        <p>The Air Jordan 19 box was unique, and when you opened the box, it kind of broke from the middle, instead of the normal open from the top or side. Each shoe is in a Air Jordan net bag.</p>

David Monette, who designs custom trumpets and engraves designs (better known as lasering) was the cause of the Air Jordan XX for having the lasering on the mid foot strap.

                        <p>Jordan Brand has used the Independent Podular Suspension (IPS) on the Air Jordan XX1 and with the success they have also
                        Air Jordan XX2 Sampleused it on the Air Jordan XX2. Unlike the past model using IPS the pods were a little difficult to remove, so on the Air Jordan XX2 the pods are square with a little tongue to pull them out. Also the interchangeable Zoom Air pod is double stacked, which reduces the cushioning hardness.</p>
                        <p>Early samples of the Air Jordan XX2 had vents on the heel with stitching starting at the heel running almost through the toe box. Samples also had a removable strap, but Michael did not like the look of the strap so this was dropped.

                        <p>When head designer of the Air Jordan XX2 D’Wayne Edwards knew the XX1 was heavy, so he had made the XX2 lighter. What caused this is the cutting of foam and midsole material also from the use of TPU composite shank plate.</p>

                        <p>The number 23 was Michael Jordan’s numberAir Jordan XX3 (23) for most of his career and now 2008 marks the 23rd year of the production of the Air Jordan line. Jordan Brand, Tinker Hatfield and Michael Jordan of course teamed up to release the Air Jordan XX3 (23) shoe. The Air Jordan XX3 will be the first basketball shoe from Nike to embrace the Nike Considered design, where details in the development and design of the shoe seek to reduce waste and allow for use of environmentally preferred materials without comprising the athletic performance. The Nike Considered design ethos is one of the several company-wide corporate responsibilities that Nike Inc. has implemented to sustain long-term growth and innovation.</p>
                        <p>The Air Jordan XX3 is one of the most complex and complicated shoes of its time and much research and development went into the shoe to find the perfect look and feel. Here are some of its features seen in the shoe. An automotive quality painting process was used for the backside of the Thermo Plastic Urethane chassis is completed by an efficient robot arm to maximize the quality, consistency and durability of the paint and component. To help out with the environment, the outsole is composed of environmentally preferred materials that reduces the toxins and uses the Nike grind material from footwear outsole manufacturing waste.</p>

The reinforced quarter panels from and holds the exact shape and the breathable tongue allows air to escape, which keeps the foot cooler.</p>
                        <p>The same ingenuity and effort that went into the upper can be seen in the mid-sole/outsole. A full length Zoom Air sole unit was used to provide superior cushioning. Another noticeable feature is how light the shoe feels. Weighing in only at 15 ounces, the lightness of the shoe increases the agility and stability.</p>
                        <p>The Air Jordan XX3 features some unique designs that add that special touch to the shoe. An imprint of Michael Jordan’s fingerprint is seen as the pattern on the outsole. More of Michael Jordan went into the shoe besides his fingerprint; his signature can be seen on the toecap, a nice touch added to the shoe. The handcrafted MJ stitch pattern offers beautiful detailing and function.</p>
